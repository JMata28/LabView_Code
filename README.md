# LabView_Code

The two VIs in this repository were used in the Summer Research prorgam at ENC during the summer of 2019. 

"Full Code using SensorDAQ.vi" is a VI that attempts to read the data from the MQ9 gas sensor and the MQ131 Ozone sensor and save them in a .CSV file. 

"Calculate RO using SensorDAQ.vi" is a VI that calculates the RO value (resistance across the MQ9 and MQ131 sensors), necessary to implement the "Full Code using SensorDAQ.vi".

"Current Reading and Storing.VI" is a VI that obtains the current readings from a Keithley 6485 Picoammeter (at a rate of about 1 reading every 0.8 seconds) and stores them in a .CSV file.
